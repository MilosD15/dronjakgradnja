## About 🚀

This website consists only of the homepage which is, at the same time, 
the landing page. The website is made for a Dutch company called ND Binnen Renovaties 
which provides painting services, electrical work services, gypsum 
work services, and so on. No framework or library is used to build this website.
Draggable slider, zooming in and zooming out 
images, and using intersection observer for full page 
animations on scroll are just some of many interesting things to see. 🤗

## Languages 🛠

## ❗ Disclaimer ❗

I have to note that the idea for draggable slider is taken 
from Traversy Media (YouTube video on his channel). 🤜🤛
