## About 🚀

I made this website without any js library or any framework 
because I want to verify my HTML, CSS, and JS knowledge 
before I start to learn and make projects with libraries 
and frameworks. I used only font-awesome for icons, smtp.js 
for sending emails, and intersection observer for scrolling 
animations. Draggable slider, zooming in and zooming out 
images, and using intersection observer for full page scrolling 
animations are just some of many interesting things to see. 🤗
## Languages and Tools 🛠

## ❗ Disclaimer ❗

I have to note that the idea for draggable slider is taken 
from Traversy Media (YouTube video on his channel). 🤜🤛
